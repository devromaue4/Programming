            <summary>
            This class implements the Photon LoadBalancing workflow by using a LoadBalancingPeer.
            It keeps a state and will automatically execute transitions between the Master and Game Servers.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This class (and the Player class) should be extended to implement your own game logic.
            You can override CreatePlayer as "factory" method for Players and return your own Player instances.
            The State of this class is essential to know when a client is in a lobby (or just on the master)
            and when in a game where the actual gameplay should take place.
            Extension notes:
            An extension of this class should override the methods of the IPhotonPeerListener, as they
            are called when the state changes. Call base.method first, then pick the operation or state you
            want to react to and put it in a switch-case.
            We try to provide demo to each platform where this api can be used, so lookout for those.

             This method excutes dispatches all incoming commands and sends anything in the outgoing queues via 
             DispatchIncomingCommands and SendOutgoingCommands.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             The Photon client libraries are designed to fit easily into a game or application. The application
             is in control of the context (thread) in which incoming events and responses are executed and has
             full control of the creation of UDP/TCP packages.
            
             Sending packages and dispatching received messages are two separate tasks. Service combines them
             into one method at the cost of control. It calls DispatchIncomingCommands and SendOutgoingCommands.
            
             Call this method regularly (2..20 times a second).
            
             This will Dispatch ANY received commands (unless a reliable command in-order is still missing) and 
             events AND will send queued outgoing commands. Fewer calls might be more effective if a device 
             cannot send many packets per second, as multiple operations might be combined into one package.
             </remarks>
             <example>
             You could replace Service by:
            
                 while (DispatchIncomingCommands()); //Dispatch until everything is Dispatched...
                 SendOutgoingCommands(); //Send a UDP/TCP package with outgoing messages
             </example>

            This operation makes Photon call your custom web-service by path/name with the given parameters (converted into JSon).
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This is a "Photon Turnbased" feature and you have to setup your Photon Cloud Application prior to use.
            
            The response by Photon will call OnOperationResponse() with Code: OperationCode.WebRpc.
            It's important to understand that the OperationResponse tells you if the WebRPC could be called or not
            but the content of the response will contain the values the web-service sent (if any).
            If the web-service could not execute the request, it might return another error and a message. This is
            inside of the (wrapping) OperationResponse.
            The class WebRpcResponse is a helper-class that extracts the most valuable content from the WebRPC 
            response.
            
            See the Turnbased Feature Overview for a short intro.

            It's best to inherit a LoadBalancingClient into your own. Implement something like:
            
                public override void OnOperationResponse(OperationResponse operationResponse)
                {
                    base.OnOperationResponse(operationResponse);  // important to call, to keep state up to date
                
                    switch (operationResponse.OperationCode) {
                    case OperationCode.WebRpc:
                    
                        if (operationResponse.ReturnCode != 0)
                        {
                            DebugReturn(DebugLevel.ERROR, "WebRpc failed. Response: " + operationResponse.ToStringFull());
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            WebRpcResponse webResponse = new WebRpcResponse(operationResponse);
                            this.OnWebRpcResponse(webResponse);
